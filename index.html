<div class="box-one"><span>A</span>bout me

    <p>Ever since I can remember, I've had an interest in computers. I would reverse engineer them in order to understand how they work. I love collecting data and running experiments to find the best possible outcomes. I have a background in carpentry and building things with my hands.
